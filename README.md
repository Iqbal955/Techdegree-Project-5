 My 5th project: Public API Requests

This app uses the Random User Generator API to pull data and use that data to build a prototype for an user directory. The data will be displayed in a grid with each user randomly generated will have a thumbnail image, full name, email and location. Clicking on the user's image will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as birthday and address.
